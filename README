#       INSTALLATION       # 
############################

1) Install Apache in /usr/local/apache.

2) Apache's root web path should be /usr/local/apache/htdocs.

3) Apache's cgi-bin path should be /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin.

4) Follow the MIMEDefang HOWTO to install MIMEDefang and supporting applications.  This
   is found at http://www.rudolphtire.com/mimedefang-howto/.  Please be aware that when
   you compile MIMEDefang, you must do configure with the following options:
   --with-spooldir=/tmpfs and --with-quarantinedir=/var/spool/MIMEDefang. Also keep in
   mind that /tmpfs should be a tmpfs file system for maximum performance.

5) Install and configure MySQL.

6) Install the following Perl modules: DBI, CGI, CGI::Cookie, Net::Pop3, GD::Graph::pie.  

7) Unzip and untar Bleach package in /usr/local (Will create a directory Bleach).

8) Run the install script (Linux Tested Only) in the bleach directory to install
   database and support files.

9) The install script creates /tmpfs off of your root filesystem.  However, to increase
   performance you may want to mount /tmpfs as a ram disk.  In other words execute the
   following:  mount tmpfs /tmpfs -t tmpfs -o size=64m (ex. 64mb ram disk ).

10) Browse to IP/DNS name of the server and begin using.  Browser must support frames,
    cookies and javascript.

Note: You must follow these instructions exactly or the system may not work.  You can send me
      questions at schmaustech@yahoo.com and I will try to help out.

Broken:  The pop3 authentication is broken until you put the required information into the authentication table in the spam db.  I will be adding a configuration page to facilitate this in the future.

Known to work with:  Solaris, Redhat Linux and Solarisx86.
